#### How to use
1. Extract the `Termlex.zip` to a folder where you have read and write permissions.
2. Verify the entries in `snomed-db.properties` to match your MySQL database that contains SNOMED CT data.
3. Set database connection properties in `termlogic-server.properties` for Termlex to store data. You can also edit this file to change the port that Termlex runs on.
4. Start Termlex using the `run.sh` or `run.bat` files in the folder.

### Configuration Folder
Termlex services can be configured using property files. Default values for the services are included in the jar files. However, it is possible to override the default values by providing property files for each of the services. Termlex has a default configuration folder called `config` located in the folder it is extracted.
The following is a list of property files that can be used to configure services:

|File name | Description | Termlex deployment location |
|:------------- |:-------------:|:-----|
snomed-db.properties | Settings to configure the database that contains SNOMED CT data | /opt/termlex/config |
termlogic-server.properties | Settings to configure the port number and database details used by Termlex | /opt/termlex/config |
obj-snomed-db.properties | Settings to configure database that stores Termlex managed local extensions |  /opt/termlex/config |
refset-db.properties | Settings to configure the database that contains refset data |  /opt/termlex/config |
